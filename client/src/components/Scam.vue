    <h1 class="bold-title">Avoiding Scams</h1>
    <p><span class="bold-title">Deal locally, face-to-face —</span>follow this one rule and avoid 99% of scam attempts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="lists bold-title">Do not extend payment to anyone you have not met in person.</li>
      <li class="lists"><span class="bold-title">Beware offers involving shipping</span> - deal with locals you can meet in person.</li>
      <li class="lists"><span class="bold-title">Never wire funds (e.g. Western Union)</span> - anyone who asks you to is a scammer.</li>
      <li class="lists"><span class="bold-title">Transactions are between users only</span>, no third party provides a "guarantee".</li>
      <li class="lists"><span class="bold-title">Never give out financial info </span> (bank account, social security, account, etc).</li>
      <li class="lists"><span class="bold-title">Do not rent or purchase sight-unseen</span>—that amazing "deal" may not exist.</li>
      <li class="lists"><span class="bold-title">"( company name )voicemails"</span> - Any message asking you to access or check "( company name ) voicemails" or "( company name ) voice messages" is fraudulent - no such service exists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="bold-title">Recognizing scams</h1>
    <h2 class="bold-title">Most scams attempts involve one or more of the following:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="lists bold-title">Email or text from someone that is not local to your area.</li>
      <li class="lists bold-title">Western Union, Money Gram, cashier check, money order, shipping, escrow service, or a "guarantee."</li>
      <li class="lists bold-title">Inability or refusal to meet face-to-face to complete the transaction.</li>
      <li class="lists bold-title">The scammer will often send an official looking (but fake) email that appears to come from ( company name ) or another third party, offering a guarantee, certifying a seller, or pretending to handle payments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="bold-title">Examples of Scams</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="bold-title">
        Someone claims your transaction is guaranteed, that a buyer/seller is officially certified, OR that a third party of any kind will handle or provide protection for a payment:
        <ul>
          <li class="lists">•	These claims are fraudulent, as transactions are between users </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Distant person offers a genuine-looking (but fake) cashier's check:
        <ul>
          <li class="lists">•	You receive an email or text (examples below) offering to buy your item, pay for your services in advance, or rent your apartment, sight unseen and without meeting you in person.</li>
          <li class="lists">•	A cashier's check is offered for your sale item as a deposit for an apartment or for your services.</li>
          <li class="lists">•	Value of cashier's check often far exceeds your item—scammer offers to "trust" you, and asks you to wire the balance via money transfer service.</li>
          <li class="lists">•	Banks will cash fake checks AND THEN HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE WHEN THE CHECK FAILS TO CLEAR, sometimes including criminal prosecution.</li>
          <li class="lists">•	Scams often pretend to involve a 3rd party (shipping agent, business associate, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
